# Chat

## Channels

Chat is split into channels, you can decide which ones to display and talk in. All channels you have permission to view are active by default. Check which channels you are currently in with command `/chlist`. The abbreviations of the channels can usually be used to set the channel, for example `/g` or `/tr`. Leave the channels you do not wish to participate in with `/leave [channelName]`. To write in a specific channel, for example town chat, run `/ch town`. The default write channel is global. Stick to English when writing in global chat so everyone can understand.

## Private messages

Send a private message with `/msg`. Quickly reply to last private message with `/r`. 

## Ignoring players

Sometimes a single player ruins chat. Instead of leaving the channel you can just ignore the individual player with `/ignore`. All messages from the ignored player will be hidden until you `/unignore`.

## Chat format

The chat format in global chat is as follows:

**[townnameâ”‚nationname] playername: message**
