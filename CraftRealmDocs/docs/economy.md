# Economy

The currency of CraftRealm is gold ingots. 1 gold ingot is 1 unit of currency. CraftRealm attempts to prevent inflation with gold sinks. Since gold is used in many aspects, it's in high demand, this creates a market environment.

## Storing the gold

The safest place to store gold is in your ender chest. It can also be deposited into the virtual town/nation bank, allowing residents with appropriate permissions to withdraw the gold and also use it for town/nation expenses such as claiming and upkeep. To deposit, run `/t deposit` or `/n deposit`. To withdraw, run `/t withdraw` or `/n withdraw`.

## How to get gold

### Mining

You can dig up gold from the ground, the best place to look being above level 32 in the [Badlands](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Badlands) biome.

### Shops

Open a shop and sell items to players for gold. All you need is stock, competitive prices and a good location. Hitting a chest, in a plot you can modify, with the item you want to sell will prompt further instructions. It's very straight forward and should only take a few seconds to set up.

### Collecting taxes

Mayors have the ability to collect taxes from residents with `/t set tax` and nation kings can collect taxes from towns with `/n set tax`. Taxes are collected once every 24 real life hours. A message is chat is sent when taxes are collected. Tax is a great tool to expand an empire and fund public infrastructure. Be careful to not set taxes too high, if a resident or town can't pay they will be kicked from the town/nation.
